## 🌿 Overview

AIRA is a luxury skincare website concept focused on emotional design, visual softness, and quiet elegance.  
The project explores how minimal UI, typography, and layout rhythm can express luxury without noise.

This is not a commercial store.  
It is a design experience.

## ✨ Design Philosophy

AIRA follows three principles:

- Simplicity over decoration  
- Emotion over promotion  
- Balance over excess  

Every section is designed to breathe.
